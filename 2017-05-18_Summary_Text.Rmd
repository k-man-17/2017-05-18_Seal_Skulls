## Introduction

Task: Seal Skull Measurements

Curator: Dr Richard Sabin, Collections Manager-Vertebrates, LS Division

The seal skull crew had to take 3 measurements of seal skulls which were from various places in Scotland. Some of the seals had been culled.

```{r out.width='75%', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('IMG_3698.JPG')
```

From looking at the tags attached to each speciment, we agreed to collect the following raw data and took it in turns to measure the skulls as selected by Richard:

```{r echo=FALSE}
cleandata <- read_csv("seal_skulls_clean.csv")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
rawdata <- read_csv("2017-05-15_Seal_Skull_raw.csv")
```

```{r include=TRUE}
tbl_df(rawdata)
```

As a back up, we wrote down each measurement:

```{r out.width='75%', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('2017-05-15_Seal_Skull_Measurements-written.JPG')
```

```{r out.width='100%', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("//2017-05-15_Photos_H.grypus//20170515_153537_HDR.jpg")
```

```{r}
?file.path
```

```{r, include=TRUE}

## Data Processing: Clean Data (LB)

```{r include=TRUE}
head(cleandata)
```


## Data Processing: Metadata (MH)

```{r echo=FALSE}
metadatashell <- read_csv("seal_skulls_metadata_shell.csv")
metadata <- read_csv("seal_skulls_metadata.csv")
```

```{r include=TRUE}
head(metadatashell)
head(metadata)
```
