## Introduction

Task: Seal Skull Measurements
Curator: Dr Richard Sabin, Collections Manager-Vertebrates, LS Division

The seal skull crew had to take 3 measurements of seal skulls which were from various places in Scotland. Some of the seals had been culled.

From looking at the tags attached to each speciment, we agreed to collect the following raw data and took it in turns to measure the skulls as selected by Richard:

```{r echo=FALSE}
cleandata <- read_csv("seal_skulls_clean.csv")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
rawdata <- read_csv("2017-05-15_Seal_Skull_raw.csv")
```

```{r include=TRUE}
tbl_df(rawdata)
```

```{r include=TRUE}
write_csv(cleandata, path = "2017-05-15_Seal_Skull_raw.csv")
```

As a back up, we wrote down each measurement:

```{r out.width='100%', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('2017-05-15_Seal_Skull_Measurements-written.JPG')
```

```{r out.width='100%', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("/2017-05-15_Photos_H.grypus/20170515_153537_HDR.jpg")
```

## Data Processing: Clean Data (LB)

```{r include=TRUE}
head(cleandata)
```
