## Seal skull mini-project

### Introduction

This repository contains data and scripts for the analysis of skull measurements from a collection of seal skulls in the Natural History Museum, London.  The raw data contain measurements of condylobasal length, zygomatic width and palatal length for 23 individuals of the species Halichoerus grypus (grey seal) collected in the British Isles.  Twenty-three of the specimens were presented to the museum by Dr. H. R. Hewer (General Letter 1961/28) and two were presented by Dr. R. M. Laws.
